 <h1>PUNCH,<br />
  OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.</h1>

  <h2>Vol. 146.</h2>
  <hr class="full" />

  <h2>February 11, 1914.</h2>
  <hr class="full" />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span>

<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Sir Edward Grey</span> is to accompany
the <span class="sc">King</span> on his visit to Paris in April
next. Nobody will grudge the <span class="sc">Foreign
Minister</span> this little treat, which he has
thoroughly well earned.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>According to <i>The Express</i> the South
African police discovered an elaborate
plot for kidnapping all the Ministers
as a preliminary to declaring a Labour
Republic. In Labour circles, however, it
is declared that the scheme was drawn
up for a joke. To this the South African
Government will no doubt retort that
the kidnapping of the Labour
leaders was also a joke&mdash;and
so the whole matter will end
in genial laughter.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>Speaking at Toronto,
ex-President <span class="sc">Taft</span> stated that
the world would have been
much worse off without England.
We believe that this is
so. Without England there
might have been no American
nation to speak of.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>Sir <span class="sc">Edward Grey</span> remarked
at Manchester that at "the time
when we built the first <i>Dreadnoughts
Dreadnoughts</i> were in
the air." So our backwardness
in naval aviation is no new
thing.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>An attempt is to be made to
raise thirteen French warships
which were sunk when the
English and Dutch fleets routed
the French off Cape La Hogue.
It is feared in nervous quarters
that this may be used by the
Germans as an excuse for further
increasing their fleet.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>Although it is frequently stated
that our army is fit to cope with the
army of any Foreign Power it is evident
that the War Office itself is not quite
satisfied, and reforms are instituted
from time to time. For instance last
week it was officially announced that
the title of Deputy-Adjutant-General,
Royal Marines, had been altered to
Adjutant-General, Royal Marines.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>"Arising out of" <span class="sc">Kid Lewis's</span> victory
last week over <span class="sc">Paul Til</span>, it is the opinion
among a good many Germans that the
French Government, being determined
that the Entente should not be imperilled,
decided to send over a French
boxer whom an Englishman could
defeat.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>Letchworth Garden City is now
considered large enough to possess
its own police court, and the Herts
County Council has sanctioned its
erection. Four Letchworth residents
have been made J.P.'s, and it is
now up to the residue to supply sufficient
criminals to make the venture
a success.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>Last week, in the City of London
Court, a man was ordered to pay £15
damages and costs for pouring a basin
of thick ox-tail soup over another man.
We are glad that this action has been
held to be illegal, as thick ox-tail is
such nasty sticky stuff.</p>

<p>Meanwhile what the law is as to
clear soup is a point which still remains
to be tested.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>According to figures published in
our bright little contemporary, <i>Fire</i>,
property amounting to £359,875 was
destroyed by fire in Great Britain
during the past year. This seems to
us more than enough, but it is not easy
to satisfy a militant suffragette.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>Mr. "<span class="sc">Mark Allerton</span>" has suggested
that London ought to have a
special golf course for beginners. If it
could be arranged for spectators to be
admitted at a moderate charge we
believe this might become one of the
most successful places of amusement in
the Metropolis.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>A suggestion that school children
shall be taken to museums, as a reward
for good school work, has been made by
Lord <span class="sc">Sudeley</span>. This is scarcely a new
idea. We remember that when we
were at school there was a feeling that
the very good boys ought to be in a
museum.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>We have been favoured with the
sight of a letter from a money-lender,
in which the following remarkable
passage occurs:&mdash;"The above terms
are for short periods, <i>to be repaid</i> as
mutually agreed upon <i>before the advance
is made</i>." The italics are ours, but
the proleptic idea is a happy
invention of the author himself.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<blockquote><p>
"<span class="sc">Spring in the Air.</span>"</p>

<p><i>Daily Mail</i>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>We are sorry not to oblige
our contemporary, but advancing
years have taken something
from our resiliency.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<h3>Another Impending Apology.</h3>

<blockquote><p>
"Dr. Glover, in giving up the
Editorship of this most valuable
periodical, has earned the grateful
thanks of the whole Diocese."</p>

<p><i>Chichester Diocesan Gazette.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<hr class="short"/>

<blockquote><p>
"A ridiculous fad that some society
ladies are adopting at the present time
is not to place any month on the date
of their correspondence, simply giving
the day of the year. Thus to-day
will be marked '34, 1914.' This is
not very difficult, but when it comes
to, say, '271, 14,' it will need more
than a little calculation to discover
the actual date."</p>

<p><i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> (<i>Feb. 4th</i>).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Even "to-day" is too difficult
for our contemporary.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>"<span class="sc">Potatoes, Potateos.</span>"</p>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Advt. in "Bedale Chronicle"</i> (<i>its
full title being "Bedale, Leyburn and
Hawes Chronicle," but that would
make the name of the paper longer than the
quotation from it&mdash;always a mistake.</i>)
</p></blockquote>

<p>We don't care for the second helping.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<blockquote><p>
"'Ha! ha!' the others laugh in their
native tongue."&mdash;<i>Evening Dispatch.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p>You should hear us gargle in German.</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>The Editor of <i>Punch</i> has reproved
his Dramatic Critic for referring to <i>It</i>,
in <i>The Darling of the Gods</i>, as "a
precocious babe." He is assured that
Mr. <span class="sc">Burtie</span>, who plays this neutral
part, "has seen some five-and-twenty
summers, and has advanced intellectual
views about most things." <i>Mr. Punch's</i>
Dramatic Critic has been instructed to
"give him double bowing" by way of
deferential compensation.</p>

<h2>BOWLES WITHOUT A BIAS.</h2>

<blockquote><p>
[With the author's congratulations to "Cap'n" <span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span>
on the appearance of his new quarterly review, <i>The Candid</i>, whose
declared aim is "to deal with Public Affairs faithfully and frankly ...
and without Party bias." Among its contents are articles on
"The New Corruption: The Caucus and the Sale of Honours," and
"An Opposition Impotent."]

<p>I know a man of simple mind,</p>
<p class="i2">Gamaliel Nibbs by name,</p>
<p>Whose early faith in human kind</p>
<p class="i2">Burned like a Vestal flame;</p>
<p>No wind of doubt that stirs the dust</p>
<p class="i2">Fluttered that bright and constant taper;</p>
<p>But oh, he had his dearest trust</p>
<p class="i2">Pinned to his daily paper.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Not once he paused awhile to ask</p>

<p class="i2">Of shaping England's thought;</p>
<p>He pictured gods that drove the pen</p>

<p class="i2">Twice in a single year,</p>

<p>Yet, even so, he would not let</p>

<h2>THE CABINET MEETS.</h2>

<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith</span>.</i> Perhaps the most important point before
us, now that the Naval Estimates are settled satisfactorily,
is the question how we're to get through the Session.
The Labour Party seems discontented.</p>

<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">Harcourt</span></i> (<i>airily</i>). I like talking over their denunciations
with them as they walk through the lobby with us
afterwards.</p>

<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith</span>.</i> Yes, I agree that their altitude is not of
overwhelming importance. Oh, by the way, I have had an
interview with Mr. <span class="sc">Redmond</span>. He is pleased to say that at
present he is favourably disposed to us.</p>

<p><i>All</i> (<i>except Lord <span class="sc">Crewe</span></i>). That's all right.</p>

<p><i>Lord <span class="sc">Crewe</span>.</i> H'm.</p>

<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">John Burns</span>.</i> I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith</span>.</i> Pardon me if I interrupt, but there is a
bad feeling in the country. A paper known as <i>The Spectator</i>
even suggests the impeachment of the Government.</p>

<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span>.</i> I am not surprised. Unprincipled
attacks are often made on me by political muckrakers.
I sometimes think that I shall give up politics.</p>

<p><i>Lord <span class="sc">Crewe</span>.</i> H'm.</p>

<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">Birrell</span>.</i> And suggestions are made that Ministers
should be hanged in Downing Street. Now in Dublin one
allows a certain latitude, but in Downing Street!</p>

<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">McKenna</span>.</i> I have consulted the police authorities
on the point. They inform me that the lamp-posts would
only bear an exceedingly light weight.</p>

<p><i>Lord <span class="sc">Haldane</span>.</i> That is most reassuring.</p>

<p><i>Colonel <span class="sc">Seeley</span>.</i> There's another threat. They talk of
the Lords throwing out the Army Bill.</p>

<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span>.</i> Good&mdash;a saving of thirty (or is it
fifty?) millions&mdash;a great democratic Budget&mdash;and an
election-winning cry, "The Lords destroy the Army."</p>

<p><i>Lord <span class="sc">Crewe</span>.</i> H'm.</p>

<p><i>Colonel <span class="sc">Seeley</span>.</i> But we need the Army.</p>

<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span>.</i> What for? Its elimination would
be a great moral example to Germany. <i>Some</i> nation must
take the lead in the peace movement.</p>

<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">Churchill</span>.</i> The third great election-winner!
I suppose National Insurance and Land go back to the
stable.</p>

<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">Burns</span>.</i> I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">Birrell</span></i> (<i>hastily</i>). But there's Ulster. What about
Ulster?</p>

<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">Churchill</span>.</i> The solution is simple. We revive
the Heptarchy.</p>

<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span>.</i> The Heptarchy was a Saxon
institution. It makes no appeal to the ardent, fervid
intensely religious Celt.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg 105]</span>

<p><i>Lord <span class="sc">Crewe</span>.</i> H'm.</p>

<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">Burns</span>.</i> I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">Harcourt</span></i> (<i>interrupting</i>). But what are we to do
about Ulster?</p>

<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith</span>.</i> We must await the reply to our offer.</p>

<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">Birrell</span>.</i> But have we made an offer? I said we
had, but have we?</p>

<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">McKenna</span>.</i> (<i>acutely</i>). We might await a reply to our
tentative offer of an offer.</p>

<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith</span>.</i> Good, <span class="sc">McKenna</span>, very good. I appreciate
the delicate distinction.</p>

<p><i>Lord <span class="sc">Haldane</span></i> (<i>aside to Lord <span class="sc">Morley</span></i>). Had <span class="sc">McKenna</span>
been caught young and forcibly educated, he would have
made a metaphysician.</p>

<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith</span>.</i> We have not yet considered whether anything
can be done to remedy the temporary unpopularity
of the Government.</p>

<p><i>Colonel <span class="sc">Seeley</span>.</i> Suppose <span class="sc">Hobhouse</span> resigned. (<i>A hum
of approval.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith</span>.</i> Say, rather, accepted a lofty Imperial post.</p>

<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">Hobhouse</span>.</i> And made room for <span class="sc">Lloyd George's</span>
Man Friday! It would mean a by-election in Bethnal
Green, where he comes from. (<i>Consternation.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">Burns</span>.</i> I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith</span></i> (<i>suddenly</i>). I accept your resignation with
great regret, <span class="sc">Burns</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">Burns</span></i> (<i>indignantly</i>). I was about to say that under
no circumstances would I resign.</p>

<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith</span></i> (<i>sadly</i>). Pardon me. I thought you were
anxious for leisure to complete your autobiography. Well,
if there are no resignations, I think we have ended the
business of the day.</p>

<h3>The Retrograde.</h3>

<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>"Come where the dates grow smaller!"</p>

<hr />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span>

<h2>A KEY TO CUBISM.</h2>

<p>The chief exponent of "the new
geometric art" explains the whole
movement in the following passage, as
reproduced in <i>The Observer</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Primitive space has entered into us, as it
were.... Against that space within us, as
against the space that appalled the savage from
without, we erect always more hard and logical
images.... All brute material, animate and
inanimate, of earth, becomes an organism to
confront the soul. Formerly the soul as a
simple figure, like a ballet, faced the environing
vagueness.</p>

<p>"Appearance then, at present, becomes a
dyke around the invision from within. And,
as a consequence even of this, the
appearance, as it is seen in art to-day,
tends to be more removed from
everyday objective reality than at
any former period of art. A new
religion is being built up, girder by
girder, around the vague spirit.
<i>Space</i>, the physical space of savage
shyness, <i>is now on our side</i>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>The comment of the writer
in <i>The Observer</i> runs thus:
"This, at any rate, is the
language of people who know
what they are about."</p>

<p><i>Mr. Punch</i>, being a little
fearful lest the average reader
of the above passage may not
share this knowledge of "what
they are about," ventures to
add his own views on Cubism,
confident that even those who
disagree will applaud his clarity.</p>

<p>From <span class="sc">Raphael</span> until <span class="sc">Pceszy
Turgidoff</span> (the brilliant young
Slav whose canvas has recently
been acquired by the Royal Geological
Museum) all true artists
have striven to adumbrate the
eternal conflict between the
morbid pathology of Realism
and the poignant simplicity of
Nihilism. In other and shorter
words, chaos must ever be on
the side of the angels. But,
until the advent of the new
Truth, the whole mission of art
had trickled into a very delta of arid
sentiment. The critic could walk all
the galleries of Europe and find
nothing to lighten his melancholy
until he entered one of those caverns
of earliest man and stood in ecstatic
reverence before the incomparable
masterpieces wherein the first of the
Futurists created (with perfect parsimony
of a sharpened flint) Man, not as
he is to his own dull eye, but Man as
he is to the inner retina of the universe.
Man, the simple triangle on two stilts,
the creature on one plane and of one
dimension, an outline without entity,
a nothingness staring, faceless, at the
nothingness which baffles his soul.</p>

<p>Emotion, idealism, beauty&mdash;these
have been always the evil spirits that
have fettered art. The new art has so
exorcised them that they have fled from
it with demoniac cries. Pulziacco's
splendid rhomboid, "Cleopatra";
Weber-Damm's tender parallelograms,
"The Daughters of James Bowles, Esq.,
J.P"; Todwarden Jones's rectilineal
wizardry, "A Basket of Oranges";
and Arabella Machicu's triumph of
astigmatism, "The Revolving Bookcase,"
are examples of this conquest of
the inner retina over the brutal insistences
of form and matter.</p>

<p>Of still deeper significance is that
terribly sad picture of Philip Martini,
"The Mumpers: a Group at Lloyds."
Nothing is more illustrative of the
courage demanded for the struggle of
the new art against convention than
this poignant work, wherein, true to
the verities, the artist has confounded
realism in its own domain by the unrecognisable
faces of his sitters.</p>

<p>Let us sum up the new movement
so clearly that the dullest will apprehend.
Surely the inhibition of all
apperceptions in art is correlative to
the inner <i>ego</i>? That simple postulate
granted, it will be unquestioned that the
true focus of vision should co-ordinate
the invisible. Faith we must have, or
we faint by the roadside of the intelligible.
The only altruism is that
which can defy the cold brutality of
things as they <i>are</i>, and convince us
with things as they <i>are not</i>. Thus
alone can the contemplation of art bring
us back to primal infelicity, and restore
in our souls the perfect vacuity of
infants and cows. Thus only can we
achieve the suffusion of vision of the
happy inebriate.</p>

<h2>THE LESSON.</h2>

<p>I was showing Celia a few fancy
strokes on the billiard table. The other
members of the house-party were in
the library, learning their parts for
some approaching theatricals&mdash;that is
to say, they were sitting round the fire
and saying to each other, "This <i>is</i> a
rotten play." We had been offered the
position of auditors to several of the
company, but we were going to see
<i>Parsifal</i> on the next day, and I was
afraid that the constant excitement
would be bad for Celia.</p>

<p>"Why don't you ask me to play with
you?" she asked. "You never teach
mo anything."</p>

<p>"There's ingratitude. Why, I gave
you your first lesson at golf only last
Thursday."</p>

<p>"So you did. I know golf. Now
show me billiards."</p>

<p>I looked at my watch.</p>

<p>"We've only twenty minutes. I'll
play you thirty up."</p>

<p>"Right-o... What do you give me&mdash;a
ball or a bisque or what?"</p>

<p>"I can't spare you a ball, I'm afraid.
I shall want all three when I get
going. You may have fifteen start,
and I'll tell you what to do."</p>

<p>"Well, what do I do first?"</p>

<p>"Select a cue."</p>

<p>She went over to the rack and
inspected them.</p>

<p>"This seems a nice brown one. Now
then, you begin."</p>

<p>"Celia, you've got the half-butt.
Put it back and take a younger one."</p>

<p>"I thought it seemed taller than the
others." She took another. "How's
this? Good. Then off you go."</p>

<p>"Will you be spot or plain?" I said,
chalking my cue.</p>

<p>"Does it matter?"</p>

<p>"Not very much. They're both the
same shape."</p>

<p>"Then what's the difference?"</p>

<p>"Well, one is more spotted than the
other."</p>

<p>"Then I'll be less spotted."</p>

<p>I went to the table.</p>

<p>"I think," I said, "I'll try and screw
in off the red." (I did this once by
accident and I've always wanted to do
it again). "Or perhaps," I corrected
myself, as soon as the ball had left me,
"I had better give a safety miss."</p>

<p>I did. My ball avoided the red
and came swiftly back into the left-hand
bottom pocket.</p>

<p>"That's three to you," I said without
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Celia seemed surprised.</p>

<p>"But I haven't begun yet," she said.
"Well, I suppose you know the rules,
but it seems funny. What would you
like me to do?"</p>

<p>"Well, there isn't much on. You'd
better just try and hit the red ball."</p>

<p>"Right." She leant over the table
and took long and careful aim. I held
my breath.... Still she aimed.... Then,
keeping her chin on the cue, she
slowly turned her head and looked up
at me with a thoughtful expression.</p>

<p>"Oughtn't there to be three balls on
the table?" she said, wrinkling her
forehead.</p>

<p>"No," I answered shortly.</p>

<p>"But why not?"</p>

<p>"Because I went down by mistake."</p>

<p>"But you said that when you got
going, you wanted&mdash;I can't argue
bending down like this." She raised
herself slowly. "You said&mdash;Oh,
all right, I expect you know. Anyhow, I
<i>have</i> scored some already, haven't I?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You're eighteen to my
nothing."</p>

<p>"Yes. Well, now I shall have to
aim all over again." She bent slowly
over her cue. "Does it matter where
I hit the red?"</p>

<p>"Not much. As long as you hit it
on the red part."</p>

<p>She hit it hard on the side, and both
balls came into baulk.</p>

<p>"Too good," I said.</p>

<p>"Does either of us get anything for
it?"</p>

<p>"No." The red and the white were
close together, and I went up the table
and down again on the off-chance of a
cannon. I misjudged it, however.</p>

<p>"That's three to you," I said stiffly,
as I took my ball out of the right-hand
bottom pocket. "Twenty-one to
nothing."</p>

<p>"Funny how I'm doing all the
scoring," said Celia meditatively. "And
I've practically never played before. I
shall hit the red hard now and see what
happens to it."</p>

<p>She hit, and the red coursed madly
about the table, coming to rest near
the top right-hand pocket and close to
the cushion. With a forcing shot I
could get in.</p>

<p>"This will want a lot of chalk," I
said pleasantly to Celia, and gave it
plenty. Then I let fly....</p>

<p>"Why did that want a lot of
chalk?" said Celia with interest.</p>

<p>I went to the fireplace and picked
my ball out of the fender.</p>

<p>"That's three to you," I said coldly.
"Twenty-four to nothing."</p>

<p>"Am I winning?"</p>

<p>"You're leading," I explained.
"Only, you see, I may make a twenty
at any moment."</p>

<p>"Oh!" She thought this over.
"Well, I may make my three at any
moment."</p>

<p>She chalked her cue and went over
to her ball.</p>

<p>"What shall I do?"</p>

<p>"Just touch the red on the right-hand
side," I said, "and you'll go into the
pocket."</p>

<p>"The <i>right</i>-hand side? Do you
mean <i>my</i> right-hand side, or the ball's?"</p>

<p>"The right-hand side of the ball, of
course; that is to say, the side opposite
your right hand."</p>

<p>"But its right-hand side is opposite
my <i>left</i> hand, if the ball is facing this
way."</p>

<p>"Take it," I said wearily, "that the
ball has its back to you."</p>

<p>"How rude of it," said Celia, and
hit it on the left-hand side, and sank
it. "Was that what you meant?"</p>

<p>"Well ... it's another way of
doing it."</p>

<p>"I thought it was. What do I give
you for that?"</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> get three."</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought the other person
always got the marks. I know the last
three times&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on," I said freezingly. "You
have another turn."</p>

<p>"Oh, is it like rounders?"</p>

<p>"Something. Go on, there's a dear.
It's getting late."</p>

<p>She went, and left the red over the
middle pocket.</p>

<p>"A-ha!" I said. I found a nice place
in the "D" for my ball. "Now then.
This is the <span class="sc">Gray</span> stroke, you know."</p>

<p>I suppose I was nervous. Anyhow,
I just nicked the red ball gently on the
wrong side and left it hanging over the
pocket. The white travelled slowly up
the table.</p>

<p>"Why is that called the grey
stroke?" asked Celia with great interest.</p>

<p>"Because once, when Sir <span class="sc">Edward
Grey</span> was playing the German Ambassador&mdash;but
it's rather a long story.
I'll tell you another time."</p>

<p>"Oh! Well, anyhow, did the German
Ambassador got anything for it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose I don't. Bother."</p>

<p>"But you've only got to knock the
red in for game."</p>

<p>"Oh!.... There, what's that?"</p>

<p>"That's a miscue. I get one."</p>

<p>"Oh!.... Oh well," she added magnanimously,
"I'm glad you've started
scoring. It will make it more interesting
for you."</p>

<p>There was just room to creep in off
the red, leaving it still over the pocket.
With Celia's ball nicely over the other
pocket there was a chance of my
twenty break. "Let's see," I said,
"how many do I want?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-nine," replied Celia.</p>

<p>"Ah," I said.... and I crept in.</p>

<p>"That's three to you," I said icily.
"Game."</p>

<h2>OUR READY WRITERS.</h2>

<p>The astonishing rapidity attained by
Mr. <span class="sc">Walter Melville</span> in the composition
of his plays as revealed in the
evidence given in court last week has
suggested an appeal to other leading
authors for information as to their rate
of production. We append the results
herewith:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Max Pemberton</span> observed that
the speed of composition varied with
the literary quality of the work produced.
Personally he found that by
far the most laborious and protracted
mental effort was entailed in the writing
of <i>Revues</i>. He had calculated that the
amount of brain force he had spent on
his last masterpiece was fully as large
as that expended by <span class="sc">Gibbon</span> on his
monumental <i>History of the Decline
and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>. In
evidence of the strain he added the
following interesting statistics. He
had worn out thirteen of the costliest
gold-nibbed fountain pens; seven expert
typists had been so exhausted that
they had to undergo a rest-cure; and
finally he himself had consumed no
fewer than nineteen seven-and-sixpenny
bottles of Blunker's Sanguinogen.</p>

<p>Sir <span class="sc">Edwin Durning-Lawrence</span>,
Bart., poohpoohed the notion that the
moderns were more rapid producers
than their forefathers. As the result
of his investigations he had conclusively
proved that <span class="sc">Bacon</span> was an infinitely
more rapid producer than any living
author. His time-table worked out as
follows. <span class="sc">Bacon</span> wrote <i>Chaucer</i> in a
little less than three weeks. He completed
the <i>Faerie Queene</i> in one sitting,
allowing for refreshments, of seventy-four
hours. The Plays of <span class="sc">Shakspeare</span>
occupied him from first to last not
more than ten months. <i>Montaigne</i> was
dashed off in just a fortnight, while
<i>Beaumont and Fletcher</i>, <i>Marlowe</i>,
<i>Greene</i>, <i>Webster</i> and <i>Ben Jonson</i> took
him exactly 37-1/2 days. Next to <span class="sc">Shakspeare's</span>
Plays the <i>Divina Commedia</i>
was his most protracted effort, costing
him nearly four months of unremitting
labour. Sir <span class="sc">Edwin</span> added in pathetic
proof of the degeneracy of the moderns
that his own famous pamphlet had
taken him twice as long to compose as
<i>Chaucer</i> had taken <span class="sc">Bacon</span>.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Hall Caine</span> strongly deprecated
the tendency to put a premium on
rapid composition, as though there were
any special virtue in speed. His own
novels, which were written with his
heart's blood, represented in their ultimate
form a rigorous condensation of
materials ten or even fifteen times as
bulky. It was in this process of condensation
that the self-sacrificing side
of true genius was most convincingly
shown. But, great as was the strain
involved in this painful process, even
greater was that imposed on a successful
author by the cruel importunity of the
interviewer on the eve of publication.
Such methods were absolutely alien to
his nature, but he had to set against
his own convenience the immeasurable
disappointment which his refusal would
cause his readers. It was one of the
most pathetic tragedies of genius that
the dictates of an austere reticence were
so often set at nought by the impulses
of a tender heart.</p>

<p>Sir H. H. <span class="sc">Howorth</span> said that the
6,500 columns of <i>The Times</i> which
he had filled in the last thirty years
had been covered in exactly 3,000
minutes or 500 hours. In his contributions
to <i>The Morning Post</i>, where
he was accorded a larger type, he had
attained a slightly greater velocity,
almost equalling that of <span class="sc">Lope de Vega</span>,
the most prolific writer on record. On
the other hand, in his <i>History of the
Mongols</i> he had adopted a rate of
progress more in keeping with the
leisurely habits of the race whose records
he was collating. He added the interesting
fact that, in spite of the saying
<i>nomen omen</i>, both Dean <span class="sc">Swift</span> and
Archdeacon <span class="sc">Hare</span> were slow composers.</p>

<h2>THE THREE WISHES.</h2>

<p>(<i>A Story for Little Innocents.</i>)</p>

<p>Once upon the usual time, a poor
but comparatively honest woodcutter
dwelt in a tiny hut on the edge of a
great forest. Since he was so poor, his
fare was simplicity itself: black bread
and a cheese of goat's milk, washed
down by draughts of cold water bottled
at a neighbouring spring&mdash;in a word,
just those articles of food which your
dear mamma has nowadays to order
specially from the most expensive
shops.</p>

<p>Well, one winter evening the poor
man was enjoying (if you can call it so)
his frugal supper as above, when there
came a gentle tap at the door; and
on opening it he perceived upon the
threshold a very old woman dressed in
a cloak of faded rags. She was so old
and so remarkably ugly that had she
been a duchess not the most inventive
of reporters could have done better
for her than "distinguished looking."
So the woodcutter, not unnaturally,
regarded his visitor with some suspicion.</p>

<p>"Kind Sir," quavered the old woman,
"I perish with hunger. Grant me, I
entreat you, a crust of bread."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the woodcutter&mdash;to gain
time. He was, of course, well aware
that there was at least a sporting
chance of the old woman being a fairy
in disguise, in which case it would be
perfectly sickening to have neglected
so good a thing. On the other hand
he knew also that there were a great
many undeserving cases. As he was
deliberating, however, he perceived
beneath the old woman's gown the
glitter of a white satin toe, and this
decided him to risk it. [N.B. For our
youthful readers, this is an infallible
sign for the detection of disguised
fairies&mdash;try it at the next pantomime
you go to.] "Come in and welcome,
Mother," said the woodcutter, and flung
wide the door.</p>

<p>Accordingly the old woman entered
the hut, and having done apparent
justice to what was left of the woodcutter's
meal, "Now," said she, striking
an appropriate attitude, "behold!"
and in the twinkling of an eye there
she stood, the complete fairy, all
shimmer and spangles.</p>

<p>"Well!" exclaimed the woodcutter,
looking as astonished as he could
manage, "I haven't a notion how that's
done!"</p>

<p>"And as a reward for your hospitality,"
continued the fairy, "choose
three wishes, and they shall be granted."</p>

<p>"I assure you," began the woodcutter
politely, "nothing was further
from my&mdash;&mdash;" but a look in the fairy's
eyes stopped him. "Of course, if you
insist," he said; adding in rather a
different tone, "Perhaps you'll excuse
me for putting the matter on a business-like
footing."</p>

<p>So saying, he produced from his
pocket a small pamphlet entitled, <i>On
Transactions with Fairies; with Some
Hints to Beginners</i>. Having studied
this for a moment, "I suppose," said
the woodcutter, "that by 'wishes' you
mean without restriction? Not anything
within reason, or economies of
that sort?"</p>

<p>The visitor looked surprised and a
little hurt. "There is no such thing
as reason in Fairyland," she said stiffly.</p>

<p>"The mistake was mine," said the
woodcutter.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg 114]</span>

<p>"Only one wish is closed to you,"
resumed the fairy; "you may not wish
to have any more wishes."</p>

<p>"That's a pity," said the woodcutter,
"especially as I'd only just thought of;
it."</p>

<p>"An obvious precaution that we were
obliged to take in our own interests.
We lost heavily in that way at one
time. But consider well. You have
the choice of wealth beyond the dreams
of avarice. You can become the most
powerful monarch in the world. Beauty
can be yours, or wisdom or piety. You
can&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wonder," asked the woodcutter,
"if you'd mind not talking for a
moment? This is a delicate crisis
and demands concentration. I think
that first of all," he continued
thoughtfully, "I will suggest
that you endow me with
perfect and unalterable self-esteem
for ever, so that in
case I make a fool of myself
over the other two wishes I
shall not have the misery of
perceiving it."</p>

<p>"It is done," said the fairy,
and at once the woodcutter
was sensible of an inward
elation like the effect of good
champagne, only more so.</p>

<p>"I'm really managing this
rather well," he thought with
a smile. "I wish the foreman
of the lumber works,
who called me a fool yesterday,
could see me now!"</p>

<p>And immediately there was
the foreman, blinking and
rubbing his eyes, and gazing
with irritation at the fairy
and the woodcutter. The
latter laughed pleasantly.</p>

<p>"That," he said to the fairy, "is
distinctly one up to you! If it wasn't
for the gift of self-esteem I should be
calling myself every kind of idiot. But
the best of us are liable to error!"</p>

<p>"You have now," the fairy reminded
him, "one wish left. Will you desire
that your task-master here be returned
to the place whence he came?"</p>

<p>"I will not," said the woodcutter.
"If it amuses him to stay, he is quite
welcome. If not, I imagine him to be
capable of walking. Let me see. At
the present moment the only wants
I can suggest are both few and simple;
a million pounds invested in Government
stock, the constitution of a
gladiator, and to be as wise as the
greatest fool on earth imagines himself&mdash;these
are the lot. But no doubt
I shall recollect others presently."</p>

<p>"One wish only," the fairy repeated
a little sharply, "and that without
delay, for time presses."</p>

<p>"You needn't rub it in," said the
woodcutter. "I have already made
my choice. Are you ready? Go!
I wish to have everything I really
want in the world." He paused expectantly,
and even a little apprehensively.</p>

<p>"It is done," said the fairy; but
nothing happened.</p>

<p>"That's all right!" said the woodcutter
with obvious relief. "I will
now, as an extra, wish both you and
the foreman good evening."</p>

<p>Whereupon he bowed them politely
out of the hut and returned chuckling
to his hygienic diet. Which appears
to show that even in the year Once
men were not always the fools that
they are usually represented.</p>

<h2>THE NOSE HAS IT.</h2>

<p>I was presiding at one of my periodical
stocktakings.</p>

<p>"Sort them all out," I had said,
"and let me see them."</p>

<p>When I had reached home they were
all there, on view.</p>

<p>There were thirty-four this time.
I went through them&mdash;A.H.L., T.W.T.,
E.F., G.H., M.L.K., O.T., B., F.W.H.,
and so forth.</p>

<p>"What a lot," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes; I think it's the biggest lot
you've ever had. Last time there were
only seventeen."</p>

<p>"And what did we do about them?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"You went through them and nothing
happened."</p>

<p>"I didn't send any back?" I said in
astonishment.</p>

<p>"No. You got ready to, and then, I
don't know why, but you didn't."</p>

<p>"What a low trick!" I said. "Worse
than borrowing books. Some of these
are pretty good, aren't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes, this one"&mdash;holding up F.W.H.&mdash;"is
a beauty. The very finest
quality."</p>

<p>I took it and felt it.</p>

<p>"It is," I said. "I wonder where
he buys them. Bond Street, I suppose.
Is there anything else as good
as that one?"</p>

<p>"No, nothing quite so good; but
these are all right;" and I was handed
E.F. and M.L.K.</p>

<p>I felt them too.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "they're first-rate."</p>

<p>I laid them on one side.</p>

<p>"Very well," I said, gathering the
rest into a bunch, "see that all those
go back with my compliments,
best thanks and regrets
for the delay. I'll keep these
three a day or so longer for
patterns."</p>

<p>Did I say that all this
happened last year? It did.</p>

<p>Yesterday I had another
borrowed-handkerchief
parade and found forty-three.
The spectacle was not without
its pathos. F.W.H. now
had a lot of holes; so had
E.F. and M.L.K. But of a
softness still!</p>

<p>All the old friends were
there too, in spite of what I
had directed.</p>

<p>"I thought these were to
have gone back," I said.
"Didn't I say so?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what?"</p>

<p>"I didn't think you really
meant it."</p>

<p>I suppose I didn't.</p>

<h2>LOVE'S LABOUR.</h2>

<p>I walked into Charles's room with
undoubted meaning&mdash;that is to say, he
could see I intended to be there.</p>

<p>"Hello!" said Charles. "Help yourself
to a chair."</p>

<p>"Thanks," I said&mdash;"thanks," and I
sat down.</p>

<p>Charles looked at me thoughtfully.
"There's something the matter," he
said.</p>

<p>"Ah! You've noticed it too, Charles.
I thought so myself."</p>

<p>"Have you any idea what it is?" he
asked.</p>

<p>I looked him steadily in the face.
"Charles," I began, "you are a stockbroker.
You know the value of money."
He groaned.</p>

<p>"Very well, I have a question to ask
you&mdash;a simple financial question. It is
this. What, in your opinion as a stockbroker,
a level-headed stockbroker, is
the least one can start on?"</p>

<p>"It all depends," he said. "Of course
there's the deposit of securities, £1000,
and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>I waved my hand. "My dear man,"
I said, "I'm not thinking of marrying
the Stock Exchange."</p>

<p>Charles closed his eyes. "Good
Lord," he murmured. "Poor old thing.
I never thought of this. Take a cigarette&mdash;or
perhaps you don't smoke now."</p>

<p>I took a cigarette with a fine independence.
I carried it further and
borrowed a match.</p>

<p>"Now," I said, "we must try and
keep to the point. What is the least
one can start on?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," he replied. "I've
never begun. By the way, I must
congratulate you. Who is she?"</p>

<p>"Daphne," I said, and smiled wanly.</p>

<p>"You don't look well."</p>

<p>"I love her," I said simply, and the
pathos of it all fairly gripped me.</p>

<p>Charles smoothed his hair. "We'd
better stick to business," he said.</p>

<p>In an instant I was a business man.
"Right," I said crisply. "Let me put
the question in another way. What is
the least on which one can start?"</p>

<p>"Well, it all depends on what sort
of an establishment you wish to keep
up. If you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing," I said quickly, "is good
enough for Daphne. She's so absolutely
sweet. She sings, Charles,
divinely. She dresses perfectly. She
plays the pianoforte exquisitely. She
sings, did I say, divinely."</p>

<p>"Talking of establishments," said
Charles&mdash;</p>

<p>"You're right," I agreed, and I
moved into a chair by the table and
drew out my fountain pen. "We shall
want a house," I began helpfully.</p>

<p>"A house? Oh, yes, I know. One
of those things with rooms. Just one
house would do for a start, I suppose?"</p>

<p>I regarded him sorrowfully. "Charles,
this is a serious matter."</p>

<p>"There's humour in everything if
you look for it. How about eight hundred?"</p>

<p>"Eight hundred!" I laughed brokenly.</p>

<p>"Well, seven hundred?"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"Six hundred? Dash it, that's very
little."</p>

<p>"Charles," I pleaded.</p>

<p>"I don't want to be hard," he said,
"but in justice to the people who come
to stay with you I can't go any lower."</p>

<p>"Not if we did without wine?"</p>

<p>"Six hundred."</p>

<p>"Wine and cigars, Charles?"</p>

<p>"Six hundred."</p>

<p>"I'll give up auction."</p>

<p>Charles cleared his throat as though
about to make a concession.</p>

<p>"Make it five," I pleaded. "Make it
five and you shall be my best man."</p>

<p>"Very well," he said, "I make it five
hundred."</p>

<p>"And now, Charles, good-bye."</p>

<p>"Why good-bye?"</p>

<p>"I love her," I said simply.</p>

<p>"Poor old thing," he said. "Let me
know about the wedding. I must make
a point of being there."</p>

<p>I pressed his hand. "You're a
brick," I said.</p>

<p>Then I hurried out into a taxi and
drove to Daphne's.</p>

<p>She refused me.</p>

<h2>THE LEAN-TO SHED.</h2>

<p>(<i>Communicated by an eight-year-old.</i>)</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>I've a palace set in a garden fair,</p>
<p>And, oh, but the flowers are rich and rare,</p>
<p class="i4">Always growing</p>
<p class="i4">And always blowing</p>
<p>Winter or summer&mdash;it doesn't matter&mdash;</p>
<p>For there's never a wind that dares to scatter</p>
<p>The wonderful petals that scent the air</p>
<p>About the walls of my palace there.</p>
<p>And the palace itself is very old,</p>
<p>And it's built of ivory splashed with gold.</p>
<p>It has silver ceilings and jasper floors</p>
<p>And stairs of marble and crystal doors;</p>
<p>And whenever I go there, early or late,</p>
<p>The two tame dragons who guard the gate</p>
<p>And refuse to open the frowning portals</p>
<p>To sisters, brothers and other mortals,</p>
<p class="i4">Get up with a grin</p>
<p class="i4">And let me in.</p>
<p>And I tickle their ears and pull their tails</p>
<p>And pat their heads and polish their scales;</p>
<p>And they never attempt to flame or fly,</p>
<p>Being quelled by me and my human eye.</p>
<p>Then I pour them drink out of golden flagons,</p>
<p>Drink for my two tame trusty dragons....</p>

<p>Who's a terrible fellow for chattering on,</p>
<p class="i4">John declares</p>
<p class="i4">They are Teddy-bears;</p>
<p>And the palace itself, he has often said,</p>
<p>Is only the gardener's lean-to shed.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>In the vaulted hall where we have the dances</p>
<p>There are suits of armour and swords and lances,</p>
<p>Plenty of steel-wrought who's-afraiders,</p>
<p>All of them used by real crusaders;</p>
<p>Corslets, helmets and shields and things</p>
<p>Fit to be worn by warrior-kings,</p>

<p>The Paynim armies at Ascalon....</p>
<p>But, bother the boy, here comes our John</p>
<p>Munching a piece of currant cake,</p>
<p>Who says the lance is a broken rake,</p>
<p>And the sword with its keen Toledo blade</p>
<p>Is a hoe, and the dinted shield a spade,</p>
<p>Bent and useless and rusty-red,</p>
<p>In the gardener's silly old lean-to shed.</p>

<p class="i4">In the shade of the trees</p>
<p class="i4">That creep so slow</p>
<p class="i4">In a stealthy row?</p>

<h2>IN EXTREMIS.</h2>

<p>A Nut lay dying. He was twenty-five. He had had a
good time&mdash;too good&mdash;and the end was near.</p>

<p>There was no hope, but alleviation was possible. "Is
there anything," he was asked, "that you would like?"</p>

<p>He was plucky and prepared for the worst.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I'd like to know what I've spent since
I was twenty. Could that be arranged?"</p>

<p>"Easily," they said.</p>

<p>"Good," he replied. "Then tell me what I've spent on
my bally old stomach&mdash;on food."</p>

<p>"On food," they replied. "We find that you have spent
on yourself an average of a pound a day for food. For five
years that is, roughly, £1825."</p>

<p>"Roughly?" said the Nut.</p>

<p>"Yes. Counting one leap year, it would be £1826. But
then you have entertained with some freedom, bringing the
total to £3075."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Nut. "And what about drinks?"</p>

<p>"We find," was the reply, "that on drinks your average
has been eighteen shillings a day, or £1643 8<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> in all."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" said the Nut. "What a noble thirst!
And clothes?"</p>

<p>"The item of clothes comes to £940," they said.</p>

<p>"Only three figures!" said the Nut. "How did I come
to save that odd £60, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"Not by any idea of economy," they replied. "Merely a
want of time."</p>

<p>"And let's see," said the Nut, "what else does one spend
money on? Oh, yes, taxis. How much for taxis?"</p>

<p>"Your taxis," they said, "work out at seven shillings a
day, or £639 2<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>"</p>

<p>"And tips?" the Nut inquired.</p>

<p>"Tips," they said, "come to £456."</p>

<p>The Nut lay back exhausted and oxygen was administered.
He was very near the end.</p>

<p>"One thing more," he managed to ask. "What have I
paid in cloak-room fees for my hat and stick?"</p>

<p>"Only £150," they said.</p>

<p>But it was enough: he fell back dead.</p>

<h2>"FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES."</h2>

<p>"You know this sort of thing isn't
good enough," said I, returning the
document to Minerva.</p>

<p>"His charges are certainly high,"
observed the lady of the house; "but
I don't think, Jack, we could get as
good a doctor anywhere for less money."</p>

<p>"I don't complain about the charges;
I suppose they are all right. What
I object to is this pompous way of
telling me I am in his debt: '<i>Mr. John
Spratt to Dr. Thom. For Professional
Services to date, Ten Guineas</i>.'"</p>

<p>"But, my dear, they all do it like
that."</p>

<p>"Then they shouldn't. Tradesmen
give full particulars of all charges made
for their services: why not doctors?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they would never agree to <i>that</i>,
Jack!" said Minerva in surprise. "It
isn't etiquette. After all, a doctor is a
doctor!"</p>

<p>"Let us hope so. At times I doubt it.
But that is not the story. How do you
suppose I am to check this account
without the necessary details?"</p>

<p>"My dear," exclaimed Minerva, "how
positively quaint you are! One never
dreams of checking a doctor's account;
one simply pays. Imagine asking a
doctor for an invoice! The idea!"</p>

<p>"And a jolly good idea too," I said.
"Then we should know where we were.
Would you pass your butcher's bills if
they merely said, '<i>For Commercial
Services to date</i>'?"</p>

<p>"That is quite a different matter.
Doctors are not butchers."</p>

<p>"Sometimes surgeons are, so it comes
to much the same. Anyhow, I object
to paying money without knowing what
for. Let's apply for an invoice, if only
for the principle of the thing."</p>

<p>"We'll do nothing of the sort," said
Minerva rather sharply. "It sounds
so mean, Jack, to ask a doctor for a
detailed account&mdash;almost as if we didn't
trust him."</p>

<p>"I shall mention that to the butcher
next time I see him, and to the other
tradesmen. It will save you a lot of
trouble about the domestic accounts."</p>

<p>"Don't be absurd. If you're so
anxious to have those petty details I
think I can remember all the doctor's
visits for you, without worrying him."</p>

<p>I drew out a sheet of account-paper.</p>

<p>"The first time he came this year,"
she began, "was to attend Tommy.
You remember&mdash;after that New Year
party. He called twice&mdash;no, three
times to see him."</p>

<p>"'<i>Item</i> 1,' I wrote. '<i>To overhauling
and repairing Tommy's tummy, time
and material, say 15s</i>.' When Tommy
next overeats himself I shall attend to
his little business myself. Yes?"</p>

<p>"Then there was Aunt Maria who
was staying with us and imagined she
had appendicitis, poor old thing! You
remember the specialist, Jack?"</p>

<p>"I remember the specialist's fee&mdash;three
guineas for absolute tomfoolery!
'<i>Item 2. To diagnosing Aunt Maria
and failing to find anything wrong and
recommending appendicitis</i>.... ' Shall
we say a guinea for Aunt Maria's put-up
job? I ought to get my money
back since nothing was found in Aunt
Maria. There should be at least a discount
on false alarms."</p>

<p>"Then there was Baby," continued
Minerva. "We didn't know what was
wrong with him&mdash;and really I don't
think now there was very much the
matter, although I felt so anxious at
the time. But the doctor never would
explain fully."</p>

<p>"Of course not; that would be giving
the game away. '<i>Item 3. To
baby to rights, 2s. 11d</i>.'"</p>

<p>"Two-and-elevenpence for baby!"
protested Minerva. "If Aunt Maria
was worth a guinea&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She was not. I said so at the time."</p>

<p>"&mdash;Baby is certainly worth more
than two-and-elevenpence."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg 118]</span>

<p>"Well, make it two pounds eleven.
I don't care either way. What I want
is an approximate idea of the way this
fellow makes up his total."</p>

<p>"If he's charging two pounds eleven
for all the little he did to Baby, he's
certainly charging too much, Jack;
and you ought to see him about it at
once."</p>

<p>"Well, what next?"</p>

<p>"That was all, I think.... Oh, no.
There was the time about Maudie's
cold."</p>

<p>"Oh, those kids' colds!"</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, I have spoken to
the children about it until I am tired.
Do be reasonable."</p>

<p>"'<i>Item 4. To thawing
Maudie's chest, lubricating
throat, and taking hard edge
off voice, time and expenses.</i>' ...
How much?"</p>

<p>"He was only twice at
Maudie, three times at
Tommy. What did you put
down for Tommy?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen bob; but Maudie
is bigger than Tommy."</p>

<p>"She is big for her age,"
reflected Minerva. "I remember
asking the doctor if
he thought she was growing
too fast."</p>

<p>"He'd call that a consultation."</p>

<p>"'<i>Item 5. To advising on
rate of speed recommended
for Maudie's growth, one
guinea.</i>'"</p>

<p>"I might have saved that
charge," sighed Minerva.
"But that was all. How
much does it come to?"</p>

<p>"Allowing two visits to
Maudie to be equal to three
visits to Tommy, the total
bill amounts to six pounds
three shillings."</p>

<p>"But that's four pounds
seven less than he charges."</p>

<p>"And observe I am allowing two
pounds eleven for Baby's fidgets&mdash;or
rather for your fidgets about baby&mdash;on
the basis of Aunt Maria being worth
a guinea a whim."</p>

<p>"Two pounds eleven for looking at
Baby's tongue every other day when
there was nothing really the matter
with him at all! It's preposterous,
Jack. There must be something wrong.
You must see Dr. Thom at once about
that account. Call to-morrow, dear,
on your way to town."</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>I called. After all there is, as
Minerva says, something inexpressibly
mean in asking a doctor for a detailed
account. This thought occurred to
me as Dr. Thom shook hands, beaming
as usual with that genial heart-warming
smile of his.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;er&mdash;Doctor&mdash;my wife would
like to see you first time you're passing,"
I managed to say.</p>

<p>"Nothing serious, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Nothing much. A little matter of
detail&mdash;that is&mdash;I mean Maudie's chest&mdash;or
rather Tommy's stomach."</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll soon put that right,
bless you. Don't you worry yourself
about that, Mr. Spratt. Beautiful
morning, isn't it?"</p>

<hr class="short"/>

<p>A little rough on Tommy, perhaps,
but rougher on me.</p>

<h3>THE WARRANT.</h3>

<p>Our village cobbler, Roberts, has
reduced the principle, "Put not thy
trust in any child of man," to its very
lowest and worst. He regards himself
as simply born to be robbed and
oppressed. Yet is he so mild and uncomplaining
and unassuming about it
all that no one, even the most persistent
robber and oppressor, could ever find it
in his heart to do him down. But
even so his pessimism and readiness to
be done are such that he must make it
very hard for people to spare him sometimes.
I have this story from our
local banker, who was called upon by
the Income Producer Company, Limited
(of some obscure address in the City of
London) to put the matter right.</p>

<p>It appears that Roberts had, after
many years of economy, amassed some
savings, which from the first he
regarded as bound to land him in
trouble. He indulged in twenty £1
shares in the I. P. Co., Ltd., only because
he had to do something with the
twenty pounds. He told everybody
that he neither expected to see his
capital again nor even to get any interest
on it. He hinted darkly at worse
things to come from the transaction,
though what these might be he didn't
pretend to know.</p>

<p>I have no inside knowledge of the
I. P. Company, except that its stock
doesn't appear among the
use of Trustee Securities.
But whatever trustees may
think of it, it did declare
at the end of 1913 (after a
somewhat prolonged silence)
a decent dividend on
its ordinary shares. Maybe
this was by reason of its
innate honesty; maybe it
was simply because it
hadn't the heart to deny
his rights to such a man as
Roberts. Anyhow it declared
its dividend, and,
what is more, proceeded to
pay it in the manner usual
to limited companies.</p>

<p>And so in due course
Roberts received a formidable-looking
piece of paper,
with the title, in very impressive
lettering, "<span class="sc">Dividend
Warrant</span>," and below
the figures £1 8<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i></p>

<p>There must be many,
among the uninstructed
classes, who have no idea
what a dividend warrant
may be, but few would, I
think, at once take the dismal
view of the thing that
Roberts took.</p>

<p>By return of post the Secretary of the
Income Producer Company, Limited,
received an envelope addressed in a
shaky hand and enclosing a postal
order for a pound, together with a
letter from Roberts, in which he prayed
for a few days of grace, in which a
poor but honest old man might raise
the further 8<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> thus demanded of
him by legal process.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mr. Charles Inge</span> has brought to the
shaping of <i>Square Pegs</i> (<span class="sc">Methuen</span>) some
good and healthy thoughts about life and
love and the waste of both, so that you get
a wholesome impression of soundness and
sincerity. And there's a dedication which
makes one think the author is writing of
realities which have been seen at close
quarters. <i>Bernard Farquharson</i>, the big-hearted
colonial, returning to England and
seeing the waste of potentially good men
in preposterous casual jobs which cannot
lead anywhere, longs to give them the
chances of the big spaces in South Africa
(where, of course, there are no Labour
troubles and a man's a man for a' that!).
He ventures his capital in <i>The Dictator</i>, a
Fleet Street derelict, in order to promote
his emigration scheme, and his capital
departs before either his public or the big-wigs
are convinced. I can't think that
<i>Bernard</i> had really thought out his scheme.
And I wonder what he would have done if
the little band of square pegs he got
together in desperation hadn't had the
sense to refuse his offer to ship them over
to South Africa with his few remaining
sovereigns. They would certainly have
been in a fine round hole at the other
side. But <i>Bernard</i> did a better thing.
The only emigrant in his party was
<i>Leonora</i>, and I like to think they lived
happily ever after on his little orange-farm.
I can only hope that his rival,
<i>Pike-Sarpe</i>, a horrible little unctuous cad
of a solicitor, will shortly do something to
attract the official attention of the Law
Society.</p>

<hr />

<p>There will, I have no doubt, be joy in
many a gentle heart over the glad news
that Mrs. <span class="sc">George Wemyss</span>, whose <i>Professional
Aunt</i> made for her so many friends,
has created yet another charming relation.
<i>Grannie for Granted</i> (<span class="sc">Constable</span>) is the
story of a delightful old lady who from
her country home takes a placid and
grandmaternal interest in the affairs of
her descendants&mdash;their love affairs mostly, of course,
or the engaging chatter of the smaller third generation.
Some of the sayings of the latter are worthy
examples of the "good enough for <i>Punch</i>" variety, which,
as most persons with married friends know too well, is a
phrase covering a wide range of quality. Most of them,
however, are excellent and ring true. Of the love-affairs I
feel myself a less competent judge, but I should fancy their
appeal will be compelling to the expert. It is perhaps
impossible for a book of this type wholly to avoid the
charge of being sugary or pretty-pretty, but with my hand
on my heart I can declare that Mrs. <span class="sc">Wemyss</span> has done less
to deserve it than most other writers would. I shudder,
for example, to imagine what certain Transatlantic novelists
would have done with the same material. In fine, here is
as pleasant and likeable a treatise on <i>l'art d'être Grand'-mère</i>
as anyone need wish to read. I am uncertain as to
the precise significance of the title, which may refer to the
fact that you have only to ask a grannie and get what you
want, or to the equal truism that grandmotherly devotion
is often accepted as a matter of course. However it doesn't
really matter. The important thing is that the public have
asked Mrs. <span class="sc">Wemyss</span> for "another of the same," and the
request has been appropriately "granted."</p>

<hr />

<p>I happen to have incontrovertible proof (of the external
kind) that the one and only Mr. G. K. <span class="sc">Chesterton</span> is the
author of <i>The Flying Inn</i> (<span class="sc">Methuen</span>). Otherwise I should
have judged, by internal evidence, that it was the work
of an inferior writer of the same name as himself, and,
curiously enough, the same initials. Though hesitating to
encourage litigation I should have been inclined to recommend
Mr. <span class="sc">Chesterton</span> to apply as soon as possible for an
injunction to restrain this person from doing anything
further to damage the real G. K. C.'s reputation. I should
have hinted that every now and then I had come upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg 120]</span>
a passage which might well be the work of the author of
<i>Heretics and Tremendous Trifles</i>, and that only the intolerable
dulness of the book as a whole persuaded me that it
had been written by another hand. It deals with the
adventures of <i>Lord Ivywood</i> and <i>Captain Dalroy</i>, men of
opposite views on the subject of temperance. <i>Lord Ivywood</i>,
having by some mysterious means (not explained)
acquired despotic power in England, issued an edict that
all inns should be abolished. At the same time he decreed
that alcoholic liquor might be sold wherever an inn-sign
stood. <i>Captain Dalroy</i> accordingly stole the sign of "The
Old Ship," and carried it about with him, setting it up
wherever his fancy dictated. And that, on my honour as a
Learned Clerk, is the whole plot of a fat, closely-printed
book of more than three hundred pages. I hope I have a
fairly catholic appreciation of humour; certainly, I can
enjoy most things, from <span class="sc">Meredith</span> to the American coloured
comic supplement; but <i>The Flying Inn</i> was too much for
me. It cannot have been easy
to write, even given useful
characters like <i>Lord Ivywood</i>
and <i>Captain Dalroy</i>, whose
remarks can be made to run
into three or four pages; but
it is considerably harder to
read. There are good things in
it, just as there is gold (I understand)
in sea-water, but the
process of extraction is tedious.</p>

<hr />

<p>Miss <span class="sc">Una Silberrad</span>'s novels
are invariably good, and <i>Cuddy
Yarborough's Daughter</i> (<span class="sc">Constable</span>),
is among the best of
them. <i>Cuddy</i> himself is delightfully
irresponsible, and I felt a
pang of disappointment when
he disappeared from the scene,
although, considering that he
became increasingly lazy and
comatose as he grew older, his
decease, perhaps, was not premature.
Apart from his affability,
<i>Cuddy's</i> only claim to distinction
lay in the fact that he
was the father of his daughter.
<i>Violet's</i> lot fell in rather stony
places; as a child she was practically the guardian of her
own father, and after his death she was governess to the
child of a woman as irresponsible as <i>Cuddy</i>, but not half so
comfortable to live with. Men swarmed round this <i>Lady
Lassiter</i>, and she loved most of them. Under the circumstances
it was fortunate that she had a most unsuspicious
and tolerant husband. With no hesitation I recommend the
tale of <i>Cuddy</i> and his daughter to the notice of all except the
ultra-moderns. But, lest I should fail as a critic if I did no
carping, I will say that, though I do not belong to any
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Infinitives, I
should like Miss <span class="sc">Silberrad</span> to look at page 94, where she
will find one that is not only split but split to smithereens.</p>

<hr />

<p>On the paper wrapper of <i>Sarah Eden</i> (<span class="sc">Mills and Boon</span>)
the publishers themselves call it "a novel of great distinction."
Filled as I am with the natural lust of the
reviewer to contradict a publisher about his own wares, I
am bound to admit that I can find no phrase more apt for
the impression this book has made upon me. There is
exceptional distinction in the scheme of Miss E. S. <span class="sc">Stevens'</span>
story, and there is even more in the grave charm and dignity
of its telling. It is the record of the development of a
singular and beautiful character; "a spiritual adventure"
might have been its sub-title, for the events in <i>Sarah Eden's</i>
life were those of mind rather than body. There are two
main divisions of the story: in the first we watch <i>Sarah</i>
from her beginnings as a quiet introspective child in her
Devon home, and through the short course of her unsatisfactory
married life. With considerable skill the author
has here shown the various forces that were at work
building up the heroine's character, and that strange blending
of a practical and commanding efficiency with the
idealism of a dreamer that exactly fitted her for the part
she plays in the second half of her story. The change
comes with the sudden death of her husband, and the first
of the ecstatic visions that compelled <i>Sarah Eden</i> to leave
her native country and prepare a place for her Divine Master
in the home of His first coming. Thenceforward the scene
is in Jerusalem, where <i>Sarah</i> establishes herself at the head
of her strange little company of
fanatics. You can see how large
is the plan of such a tale; it is
one of which you could not
reasonably expect a wholly
satisfactory ending, and to my
mind the latter portion is the
weaker. But there are some
delightful scenes of life in
modern Jerusalem. And <i>Sarah
Eden</i> herself remains always a
profoundly moving personality.
For her alone the book deserves
to be called "a novel of great
distinction."</p>
